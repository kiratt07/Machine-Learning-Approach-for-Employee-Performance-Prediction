# Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Employee-Performance-Prediction


This project presents a machine learning-based web application that predicts the productivity score of garment employees based on various performance metrics and work-related parameters. The solution leverages regression models to analyze factors such as department, working hours, idle time, and incentives to provide real-time productivity predictions.

The application is built using Python, Flask for the web framework, and popular ML libraries like scikit-learn, XGBoost, and pandas. A user-friendly UI allows HR managers or team leads to input employee data and receive instant productivity forecasts, aiding in resource planning, performance improvement, and talent management.

 Key Features:
 User interface with form-based input using Flask + HTML + Bootstrap
 Real-time prediction of employee productivity
 Preprocessing includes missing value handling, categorical encoding, and feature scaling
 Three regression models used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
 Evaluation with metrics: MAE, MSE, and RÂ² Score
 Best model (XGBoost) saved and deployed for predictions
 Full-stack integration: ML + Web UI
 Tech Stack:
